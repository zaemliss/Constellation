** Twitter bot ** 
also has discord integration code as an example and some rudimentary searching/triggers 

Also it will require a botconfig.json configured like this:
```

{
    "token": "your_token_here",
    "prefix": "!"
}
```


===================================================
** Telegram bot is an anti-spam bot I made but has all the functions required to search and act on input **
To use as-is (as an anti-spam bot) it requires a rules.json file formatted as such - there is also a segment that deals with undesirable executables
```JSON

    "rule01": { "name": "press this link", "weight": 3 },
    "rule02": { "name": "money",  "weight": 1 },
